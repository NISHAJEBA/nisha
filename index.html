<p class="special_para">The rupee in your pocket has a mysterious past. Behind Mahatma Gandhi's smiling face lies a long history of struggle, exploration, and wealth that can be traced back to the ancient India of the 6th century BC. Let's demystify this history by bringing you the interesting stories about how Indian currency has evolved over the ages into the rupee of today.</p>
<p>Ancient Indians were the earliest issuers of coins in the world, along with the Chinese and Lydians (from the Middle East). The first Indian coins punch marked coins called Puranas, Karshapanas or Pana were minted in the 6th century BC by the Mahajanapadas (republic kingdoms) of ancient India. These included Gandhara, Kuntala, Kuru, Panchala, Shakya, Surasena, and Saurashtra.</p>

<p>On August 15, 1950, the new anna system was introduced the first coinage of the Republic of India. The British King's portrait was replaced with the engraving of Ashoka's Lion Capital of Sarnath, and the tiger on the 1 rupee coin was replaced with a corn sheaf. One rupee now consisted of 16 annas.
The 1955 Indian Coinage (Amendment) Act, which came into force on April 1, 1957, introduced a decimal series. The rupee was now divided into 100 paisa instead of 16 annas or 64 pice.The coins were initially called naye paise, meaning new paise, to distinguish them from the previous coins.</p>

<p>In order to aid the blind in the country, each coin had distinctly different shapes the round 1 naya paisa, scalloped edge 2 naya paisa, the square 5 naya paisa, and the scalloped edge 10 naya paisa.Also, prior to Independence, the Indian currency was pegged against silver. The silver-based rupee fluctuated according to the value of silver and had a distinct disadvantage when trading against currencies that were based on the gold standard. This was rectified post-Independence.</p>

<p>Later, in 1996, the Mahatma Gandhi Series was introduced with prominent new features such as changed watermarks, windowed security threads, latent images, and intaglio features for the visually handicapped. This was replaced in 2005 by the MG series notes that had some additional security features.

In 2010, India celebrated its hosting of the Commonwealth Games with commemorative 2 and 5 Rupee coins. One side of these coins features the logo of the Games while the other features the three lions from the pillar of Ashoka. In the same year, India also adopted the new symbol for the rupee with new coins bearing this symbol being launched in 2011.</p>
